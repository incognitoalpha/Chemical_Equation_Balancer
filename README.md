# Chemical Equation Balancer and Element Property Viewer

This Python-based application provides a graphical interface for balancing chemical equations and displaying the properties of elements involved in the reaction. It uses several libraries, including **Tkinter** for the GUI, **Pandas** for data handling, and **SymPy** for symbolic computations.

## Features

- **Chemical Equation Balancer**: Automatically balances chemical equations entered by the user in skeletal format.
- **Element Property Viewer**: Displays a detailed table of properties for unique elements in the chemical equation.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Plots variations of selected properties for the elements using Matplotlib.
- **Dark Theme**: The application uses a dark-themed GUI for enhanced user experience.
